# UniHub (short for Universal Hub), my pet-project
***Essence: This is a universal platform for communication, storage and processing of information, which combines:***

  💬 Chat system with registration and authorization (like a messenger)

  🌐 Data parsing from external sites (for example: news, weather, exchange rates)

  📊 Analytics and statistics (user activity, number of messages, most popular topics)

  🖥️ Web interface (React + FastAPI)

  🛠️ API for integrations (you can connect a bot, mobile application or other services)

  ⚡ Script module (for automation: reminders, scheduling, file processing)
